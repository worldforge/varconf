ChangeLog for varconf
Friday, 13th June, 2003, Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>
	* Remove support for sigc++ 1.2 from this legacy version. This version
	  is now the recommended version for use with application which
	  require sigc++ 1.0. Application which require sigc++ 1.2 should
	  use the 0.6 series or later.

Friday, 17th April, 2003, Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>
	* Fix up headers for clean handling, and portability.

Friday, 30th January, 2003, Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>
	* Added mechanism to differentiate between varconf built
	  against sigc++ 1.0 and 1.2, and use pkg-config to
	  detect the 1.2 version.

Friday, 13th December, 2002, Michael Koch <konqueror@gmx.de>
	* Added manpage for varconf-config.

Monday, 2nd September, 2002, Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>
	* Increment version to 0.5.4
	* Release 0.5.4

Sunday, 11th August, 2002, Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>
	* Fixed Variable's copy constructor to work properly
	  with the changes in the ref counting code

Sunday, 11th August, 2002, Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>
	* Integrated patch by Ron Steinke to remove dependancy on
	  sigc++ 1.0.x internals. Modified configure script and includes
	  to be compatable with sigc++ 1.2.

Tuesday, 6th August, 2002, Simon Goodall <simon@simongoodall.co.uk>
	* fixed varconf/config.cpp so parseStream now allows - and _ characters in a section name instead of throwing an exception.

Saturday, 20th June, 2002, Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>
	* Add --enable-debug to configure.in
	* Use rpm supplied compiler flags in spec.
	* Increment version, and release

Saturday, 20th June, 2002, Michael Koch <konqueror@gmx.de>
	* Depend on sigc++ >= 1.0.2
	* cleaned up Makefile.am

Monday, 10th June, 2002, Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>
	* Fixed rpm spec into two different packages, and corrected generation
	  of interface version.

Wednesday, May 21 2002, Michael Koch (man-di)
	* tests/Makefile.am: make tests link
	
Wednesday, May 21 2002, Michael Koch (man-di)
	* Updated AUTHORS file
	* Made some text files more readable
	* removed generated file from CVS

Saturday, May 11 2002, Joel Schander (nullstar)
	* Added comments after member functions in Config.h.  Wasn't clear
	  on purpose of setParameterLookup() so didn't add anything.

Friday, March 19 2002, Martin Pollard

	* Fixed one of variable.cpp's operator<<'s  doesn't
	  seem to be in use right now anyway.
	
Friday, March 08 2002, James Turner

	* Added varconf-config and varconf.m4, plus configure
	  changes.
	* Bumped the version up
	* Set the .so version correctly, thanks to WFMath /
	  Ron Steinke for the help/
 	* Tweaked makefiles (using builddir when then they
	  should have been using srcdir) and .cpp files (using
	  < > includes when they should have been using "..").
	* make distcheck works cleanly.

Wednesday, Decemer 18, 2001 -- Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>
  * C++ compliance fixes, for compiling under gcc v3.

Sunday, November 11, 2001 -- Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>
  * variable.h, variable.cpp, dynbase.h: Added the capacity for
    Variable to hold an array of Variable (really vector<Variable>)
  * variable.h, variable.cpp: Added operator=(const char*),
    previously had both char* and std::string as constructors
    but only std::string as an assignment operator

Wednesday, November 7, 2001 -- Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>
  * dynvar.h: Forgot the "inline" keyword. Oops.

Wednesday, November 7, 2001 -- Ron Steinke <rsteinke@w-link.net>
  * Changed the Variable class to a smart pointer to its old implementation,
    essentially %s/Variable/VarBase/g, then wrote a new Variable class
    based on SigC::Handle with the Variable API added.
  + added dynbase.h, dynbase.cpp, dyntypes.h, dyntypes.cpp,
    dyncmp.h, dyncmp.cpp, dynvar.h; these provide derived types
    of VarBase which dynamically depend on the configuration
    variables in Config::inst(), the user interface (for most
    purposes) consists of the functions in dynvar.h which
    deal only with class Variable
  + added doc/.cvsignore, doc/old/.cvsignore to ignore Makefile, Makefile.in
  * modified tests/.cvsignore to ignore .libs directory
  * modified varconf/.cvsignore to ignore new .lo objects
  * modified varconf.spec.in to add new header files

Saturday, August 4, 2001 -- Joseph A. Zupko <jaz147@psu.edu>
  * fixed outdated information, formatting and wording in README.
  * minor fixes to config.cpp

  * overhauled configuration.in and all Makefile.am
  * updated varconf version to 0.5.0

Saturday, May 19, 2001 -- Joseph A. Zupko <jaz147@psu.edu>
